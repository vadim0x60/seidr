0	Make sure that {i} -> {o}
1	Ensure {i} -> {o}
2	From input {i} get output {o}
3	Input: {i}, output: {o}
4	Test pair: ({i}, {o})
5	Modify code to get {o} from {i}
6	Code must correspond instructions in docstring and {i} must yield {o}
7	Code should correspond instructions in docstring and {i} should yield {o}
8	Program takes {i} as input string and returns {o} as output string
9	Program takes {i} as input and returns {o} as output
10	Program takes {i} and returns {o}
