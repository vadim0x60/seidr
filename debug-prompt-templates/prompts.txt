0	Make sure that {i} -> {o}
1	Make sure that input {i} yields output {o}
2	Make sure that for input {i} we get output {o}
3	Make sure that we get {o} as output for input {i}
4	Make sure the code retuns {o} for input {i}

9	Ensure the code retun {o} for input {i}
10	Input {i} must yield output {o}
11	Return {o} for input {i}
12	From input {i} get output {o}
13	Input: {i}, output: {o}
14	Test pair: ({i}, {o})
15	Modify code to get {o} from {i}
