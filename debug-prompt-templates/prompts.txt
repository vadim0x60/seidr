0	Make sure that {i} -> {o}
1	Make sure the code retuns {o} for input {i}
2	Ensure that input {i} yeilds output {o}
3	Return {o} for input {i}
4	Input: {i}, output: {o}
5	Test pair: ({i}, {o})
6	Modify code to get {o} from {i}
7	Code must correspond instructions in comments and {i} must yield {o}
8	Program takes {i} as input and returns {o} as output
9	See comments in code and return {o} for input {i}
